Following that, the pipeline applies FastTree to generate a phylogenetic tree from the masked alignment. The FastTree program creates an unrooted tree, so in the final step in this section midpoint rooting is applied to place the root of the tree at the midpoint of the longest tip-to-tip distance in the unrooted tree."

Because most diversity metrics are sensitive to different sampling depths across different samples, this script will randomly subsample the counts from each sample to the value provided for this parameter. For example, if you provide --p-sampling-depth 500, this step will subsample the counts in each sample without replacement so that each sample in the resulting table has a total count of 500. If the total count for any sample(s) are smaller than this value, those samples will be dropped from the diversity analysis. Choosing this value is tricky. We recommend making your choice by reviewing the information presented in the table.qzv file that was created above.

This value was chosen based on the number of sequences in the L3S313 sample because it’s close to the number of sequences in the next few samples that have higher sequence counts, and because it is considerably higher (relatively) than the number of sequences in the samples that have fewer sequences. This will allow us to retain most of our samples. The three samples that have fewer sequences will be dropped from the core-metrics-phylogenetic analyses and anything that uses these results. It is worth noting that all three of these samples are “right palm” samples. Losing a disproportionate number of samples from one metadata category is not ideal.

    "Next we’ll analyze sample composition in the context of categorical metadata using PERMANOVA (first described in Anderson (2001)) using the beta-group-significance command. The following commands will test whether distances between samples within a group, such as samples from the same body site (e.g., gut), are more similar to each other then they are to samples from the other groups (e.g., tongue, left palm, and right palm). If you call this command with the --p-pairwise parameter, as we’ll do here, it will also perform pairwise tests that will allow you to determine which specific pairs of groups (e.g., tongue and gut) differ from one another, if any. This command can be slow to run, especially when passing --p-pairwise, since it is based on permutation tests. So, unlike the previous commands, we’ll run beta-group-significance on specific columns of metadata that we’re interested in exploring, rather than all metadata columns to which it is applicable. Here we’ll apply this to our unweighted UniFrac distances, using two sample metadata columns, as follows.\n"

    "In this section we’ll explore alpha diversity as a function of sampling depth using the qiime diversity alpha-rarefaction visualizer. This visualizer computes one or more alpha diversity metrics at multiple sampling depths, in steps between 1 (optionally controlled with --p-min-depth) and the value provided as --p-max-depth. At each sampling depth step, 10 rarefied tables will be generated, and the diversity metrics will be computed for all samples in the tables. The number of iterations (rarefied tables computed at each sampling depth) can be controlled with --p-iterations. Average diversity values will be plotted for each sample at each even sampling depth, and samples can be grouped based on metadata in the resulting visualization if sample metadata is provided with the --m-metadata-file parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: HOW TO CHOOSE MAX-DEPTH?\n",
    "\n",
    "Note\n",
    "\n",
    "The value that you provide for --p-max-depth should be determined by reviewing the “Frequency per sample” information presented in the table.qzv file that was created above. In general, choosing a value that is somewhere around the median frequency seems to work well, but you may want to increase that value if the lines in the resulting rarefaction plot don’t appear to be leveling out, or decrease that value if you seem to be losing many of your samples due to low total frequencies closer to the minimum sampling depth than the maximum sampling depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "The visualization will have two plots. The top plot is an alpha rarefaction plot, and is primarily used to determine if the richness of the samples has been fully observed or sequenced. If the lines in the plot appear to “level out” (i.e., approach a slope of zero) at some sampling depth along the x-axis, that suggests that collecting additional sequences beyond that sampling depth would not be likely to result in the observation of additional features. If the lines in a plot don’t level out, this may be because the richness of the samples hasn’t been fully observed yet (because too few sequences were collected), or it could be an indicator that a lot of sequencing error remains in the data (which is being mistaken for novel diversity).\n",
    "\n",
    "The bottom plot in this visualization is important when grouping samples by metadata. It illustrates the number of samples that remain in each group when the feature table is rarefied to each sampling depth. If a given sampling depth d is larger than the total frequency of a sample s (i.e., the number of sequences that were obtained for sample s), it is not possible to compute the diversity metric for sample s at sampling depth d. If many of the samples in a group have lower total frequencies than d, the average diversity presented for that group at d in the top plot will be unreliable because it will have been computed on relatively few samples. When grouping samples by metadata, it is therefore essential to look at the bottom plot to ensure that the data presented in the top plot is reliable.\n",

    "It has been shown that taxonomic classification accuracy of 16S rRNA gene sequences improves when a Naive Bayes classifier is trained on only the region of the target sequences that was sequenced (Werner et al., 2012). This may not necessarily generalize to other marker genes (see note on fungal ITS classification below). We know from the Moving Pictures tutorial that the sequence reads that we’re trying to classify are 120-base single-end reads that were amplified with the 515F/806R primer pair for 16S rRNA gene sequences. We optimize for that here by extracting reads from the reference database based on matches to this primer pair, and then slicing the result to 120 bases.\n",

    "The --p-trunc-len parameter should only be used to trim reference sequences if query sequences are trimmed to this same length or shorter. Paired-end sequences that successfully join will typically be variable in length. Single-end reads that are not truncated at a specific length may also be variable in length. For classification of paired-end reads and untrimmed single-end reads, we recommend training a classifier on sequences that have been extracted at the appropriate primer sites, but are not trimmed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note\n",
    "\n",
    "The primer sequences used for extracting reads should be the actual DNA-binding (i.e., biological) sequence contained within a primer construct. It should NOT contain any non-biological, non-binding sequence, e.g., adapter, linker, or barcode sequences. If you are not sure what section of your primer sequences are actual DNA-binding, you should consult whoever constructed your sequencing library, your sequencing center, or the original source literature on these primers. If your primer sequences are > 30 nt long, they most likely contain some non-biological sequence.\n",

    "The example command uses the min-length and max-length parameters to exclude simulated amplicons that are far outside of the anticipated length distribution using those primers. Such amplicons are likely non-target hits and should be excluded. If you adapt this command for your own use, be sure to select settings that are appropriate for the marker gene, not the settings used here. The min-length parameter is applied _after_ the trim-left and trunc-len parameters, and max-length _before_, so be sure to set appropriate settings to prevent valid sequences from being filtered out."

Hence, you may see two different types of “underclassification” in your data: e.g., k__Bacteria; p__Firmicutes; c__Clostridia; o__Clostridiales; f__Christensenellaceae; g__; s__ (genus and species annotations are missing in Greengenes) as well as k__Bacteria; p__Firmicutes; c__Clostridia; o__Clostridiales; f__Christensenellaceae (q2-feature-classifier could not confidently classify that ASV at genus level).\n",

If you expect that more features are changing between your groups, you should not use ANCOM as it will be more error-prone (an increase in both Type I and Type II errors is possible). Because we expect a lot of features to change in abundance across body sites, in this tutorial we’ll filter our full feature table to only contain one sample type. We’ll then apply ANCOM to determine which, if any, sequence variants and genera are differentially abundant across each sample type of the different locations.\n",

We can't really tell this apart. But ANCOM can do all of the comparisons between features. Then we can determine which of these is more significant. We can look at the feature that has the most significant changes with other features, and this is likely to be the differentially abundant feature. The number of signicant edges is the W score for that feature. W=5 is the theoretical maximum for an example with 6 features, but it could be less than this. We want to look at the distribution of these W scores. We expect that the distribution will be bimodal - some features will have a high W and some will have a low W. This is how we identify which features are differentially abundant and in what direction. \n"
